            <h2>What is Global Warming?</h2>
            <p>Global warming is the term used to describe the rise in the Earth's average temperature over time. It's mostly caused by human activities, like burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) and cutting down trees. These actions release gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the air. These gases trap heat from the sun, like a blanket around the Earth, which makes the planet warmer. This is called the "greenhouse effect."</p>

            <h2>How Does Global Warming Happen?</h2>
            <p>Imagine Earth is like a big house with windows. When the sun shines on Earth, it warms the planet. Normally, some of this heat escapes back into space. But because of extra gases in the air, like carbon dioxide, the heat gets trapped and can't escape. This causes the Earth to heat up slowly over time.</p>

            <h2>Why is it Important?</h2>
            <p>Global warming leads to many changes in the environment that can be harmful. Some of the biggest problems caused by global warming are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels:</strong> As the Earth gets warmer, ice at the North and South Poles starts to melt. This causes sea levels to rise, which can flood coastal cities and homes.</li>
                <li><strong>Changing Weather Patterns:</strong> Global warming can cause extreme weather, like more powerful hurricanes, longer droughts, and heavier rains. These weather changes can make it harder for people to grow food and can damage homes and businesses.</li>
                <li><strong>Threats to Animals and Plants:</strong> Many animals and plants are adapted to specific temperatures and climates. Global warming can force them to move or die out if they can’t survive in the changing conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Risks:</strong> Warmer temperatures can lead to more air pollution and increase the spread of diseases carried by insects, like mosquitoes.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="how-to-help">
            <h2>How to Help</h2>
            <p>Even though global warming is a big problem, there are things we can do to help reduce its effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use less energy:</strong> Turn off lights when you don’t need them, and use energy-efficient appliances.</li>
                <li><strong>Walk, bike, or use public transportation:</strong> This helps reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released by cars.</li>
                <li><strong>Plant trees:</strong> Trees absorb carbon dioxide and help cool the Earth.</li>
                <li><strong>Recycle:</strong> Recycling helps reduce waste and the pollution that comes from making new products.</li>
            </ul>
